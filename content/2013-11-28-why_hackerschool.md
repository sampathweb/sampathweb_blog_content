<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
Haker School is a Twelve week program to practice the art of programming with other Hacker Scoolers helping each other do more of what we love.  Hacker Scool calls it "Writers retreat for programmers".  I have been programming for a while, but Why am I am applying for the upcoming winter session?

Learning by doing

Not Convinced?

Read the blog posts by some of the current and past hacker schoolers.  I particularly like the following blog posts:

* [Julia Evans](http://jvns.ca/).  I met Julia at PyData Conference in NYC last month and she gave a talk on using Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize data.  One of my goals in Hacker School is to accelarate my knowledge of machine-learning algorithms and make sense of data.  Having a chance to meet others who have similar aspirations and lots of energy would be great reason to be at work early (I mean School).

* [Jane Wang](http://janelwang.com/post/39331427467/q-a-5-questions-about-hacker-school).  In her blog, Jane notes that she came to Hacker Scool knowing NodeJS, Python and having done a startup.

I hope both these posts, help convince you that even if you know somethinig well, you can still learn a lot from being at Haker School.  It did for me.
