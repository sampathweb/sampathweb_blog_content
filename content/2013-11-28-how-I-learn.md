<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
My son's in fourth grade, the youger one is about to join a pre-school and caught a comment from my older one telling younger that daddy's still in school.  That's right, I have been studying more now than I ever did during my school years.  But I learn what I want and it's lot of fun.
