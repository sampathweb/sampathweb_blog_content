<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
Euler Project is a great resource to solve some puzzles writing code and explore areas of the language that we don't normally explore.  It's like playing chess, but we get to write the code to solve it.

Other ways?
-----------

Can you think of other ways to solve the same problem?  

I love the idea that in languages like Python, Javascript we can pass functions around just like data.  Functional programming might have more ways to do it, and I look to try them someday.
