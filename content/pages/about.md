<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

I spent first fifteen years after college working with databases, and data warehouses using mostly SAP technoliges.  It was March'2010 when I realized that I no longer want to live the life as a data warehousing consultant, but want to build products that enable small businesses make sense of data.

Over the last three years, I have dabbled around in a lot of different open source software.  In the past year, I teamed up with couple of my friends and built [EngineRoom360](www.engineroom360.com).  Engineroom360 was started to help small businesses selling online to understand what their customers wanted and place the products where the customers would find them.  Our software moved the products in the online store and also allowed small busnesses run better promotions.  Although we had some success over the last year, it did not succeed in the way we would have liked to see.  Small businesses have a bigger problem of bringing traffic into the store.  I could not continue funding myself on this startup and have left it for now for my other co-founders to continue with it.  At this moment, I am looking at ways to improve myself and be better at my craft.

I started learning Ruby on Rails in 2010, then did some R-Statistics and found my home in Python community.  Rails and R-Stats are great communities, but I need one that worked on problems with Data as well as with Web Technologies.  My goals for 2014 is to use Python for Data Science and also learn Javascript and some CSS to bring Science to the Web.

I program now mostly in Python (Web and Data Stack) and Javascript.  Although every now and then, I would peek into Scala / Golang and Julia to see what functional programming is all about.

Because a large part of open source software is about the community, I went to a number of conferences to learn and understand what kind of problems are being solved.  Here's what I learned and why I choose Python -

* Scipy 2012, 2013 and 2014 - Austin, TX

Scipy 2012 was my first Python conference and as you would see below became the community I enjoyed being part of.  In 2012, I saw late John Hunter give a great keynote on MatPlotLib from the early days to 2012 and also his vision for the future.  Within a few months after that, He was diagnosed and succumbed to cancer.  I had never seen anyone who had contributed so much to open source with MatPlotLib, but yet so humble.  I learnt a bit about numpy, scipy, scikit and met many of the creators of these libraries.  I was glad this conference was held in my city of Austin, Texas and knew that I would return back again in 2013.

Scipy 2013 was exciting with all the buzz around the whole day Scikit-learn tutorial.  I had been to a few other Scikit workshops, but since I don't use them in my work I never got the hang of it.  I finally understood the Transform-Fit-Predict apis of Scikit and how the various classifiers have the same interfaces.  I leant about the grid search method to identify the parameters for these models.  This is where Statitics (R-Stat) community is very different from Machine Learning (Scikit) comminity.  R-stats is primarily used by folks that want to understand the Model, whereas Scikit users are more concerned about the model accuracy than the model being explainable.  This is a broad statement, but shows what problems the differnt communities are solving and their background being Stats vs Computer Science.

* Summer Statistics and Data Mining bootcamp workshops at UT Austin - May'2010, May'2012, May'2013 and May'2014

I have enjoyed the Statistics / Data Mining four day workshops at UT Austin.  They have a powerful statistics group and wish I knew about it when I was doing my Masters there.  They mostly use R-Stats in these workshops and was really useful to get my started in many of the statistical concepts.  I just wish that they use business data like Advertising, Search or web traffic data.

* PyTexas 2012 and 2013

* PyData - NYC 2012, Santa Clara 2013, Boston 2013, NYC 2013, Silicon Valley 2014

* PyCon 2013 - Santa Clara

* Texas JavaScript 2013 - Austin, TX

* HTML Conference 2013 - Austin, TX

* UseR conference 2012 - Nashville, TN

Very powerful community.  Got introduced to R-Studio.  I met and shook hands of many who have created the R-packages that everyone in R-stats reaches out in their toolbox.  It's was a who's who of R-Stats community and they gave me few minutes of their time to help me understand where to get started.  Met Hadley Wickham, Knitr etc.  The community was mostly dealing with making sense of data that can fit in memory, read from CSV.  What bothered me about R-Stats is that when you import a R-package, it loads into global namespace.  So, the order of import of package becomes important if the packages don't choose their API interfaces well.  It bothered me that I could not easily tell which package is being used to run a function.  Also, for most usecases, R-stats was used for individual data exploration than being part of an larger application.  That being said, I still reach out for R-Studio when I struggle with Python / Matplotlib and needed to make a quick plot with ggplot.

* PyGotham, 2012 - NYC

This was my first conference in NYC and due to last minute venu cancellation was done on a boat.  I had never been on a cruise and was great to learn Python from Mike Baker, Wes McKinney, Gloria (NYC Python) on a boat though it didn't go anywhere.  The energy and pace of NYC is something I enjoy everytime I visit the big Apple.

* PyCarolinas 2012 - Raleigh, NC

* RailsConf 2012 - Austin, Texas

This was the first conference I went to and met @dhh and @wycats and many awesome folks in Rails community.  Rails community is just awesome at sharing and helping new members.  I leart a lot via CodeSchool and Railscasts and Rails Tutorials.  I built a few Rails applications as well and it looked easy once you accept the magic that comes with Rails.

* Lone Star Ruby Conf 2012 - Austin, Texas

I met the Ruby creator and was flored by his humbleness.  There he was at Noris Conference Center greeting folks coming to the regional conference. This was my second Ruby conference and things started to get clear on who really is using Ruby.  The community was around building applications that automate work flows and social apps but is not primarily concerned with making sense of all the data.  That's not what Rubyists that I met did.  I really liked the community, but I had to move on.  They did not work on the problems I cared.
